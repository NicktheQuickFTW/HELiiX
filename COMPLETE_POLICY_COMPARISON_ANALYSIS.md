# Complete Big 12 Policy Comparison & Action Plan

## Executive Summary

After analyzing all 12 administrative manual files from `/Users/nickw/Downloads/XII Admin mds/`, I've identified several critical issues and opportunities for improvement in the Big 12 policy documentation system.

## Critical Issues Identified

### üö® **File Organization Problems**

1. **File 7 SOC.md contains SOFTBALL content instead of SOCCER**
   - This is a duplicate of file 8 SB.md (Softball)
   - Actual soccer policies are missing from the new manual set
   - Soccer policies exist in current system: `big12-soccer-policies.md`

2. **Missing Sports Coverage**
   - No manuals provided for several Big 12 sports:
     - Beach Volleyball (3 teams: Arizona, Arizona State, TCU)
     - Cross Country (M: 13 teams, W: 16 teams)
     - Golf (M: 16 teams, W: 14 teams)
     - Swimming & Diving (M: 7 teams, W: 10 teams)
     - Track & Field Indoor/Outdoor (varying team counts)
     - Rowing (6 teams)
     - Equestrian (4 teams)
