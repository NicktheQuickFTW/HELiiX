# Big 12 Policy Comparison Analysis

## Summary of Findings

Based on comparison between the "Big 12 Conference Handbook.md" and the comprehensive sport policy files, here are the key findings:

### 1. Handbook Status

The "Big 12 Conference Handbook.md" appears to be **incomplete** - it only contains Baseball policies (45 lines total) rather than a comprehensive handbook covering all sports.

### 2. Baseball Comparison: Handbook vs. Comprehensive Policy

#### Policies in Comprehensive File Missing from Handbook:

- **Foreign Substance Policy** - Detailed pitcher inspection requirements
- **Technology & Broadcast** - Video replay, stat tracking, radio networks
- **Temperature Policy** - Game start restrictions, heating requirements
- **Administrative Structure** - Governance and conference rules references
- **Academic Awards** - Conference academic recognition programs
- **Conference Credentials** - Access and credentialing policies
- **Public Comments Policy** - Media and public statement guidelines
- **Teamworks Integration** - Official operating system procedures
- **Conference Branding** - Brand usage and compliance

#### Key Areas Where Handbook May Have More Detail:

- **Specific Game Procedures** - Step-by-step operational details
- **Detailed Timing Protocols** - The comprehensive file references but doesn't include specific timing
- **Operational Procedures** - Day-of-game management details

### 3. Missing Sports Analysis

The handbook is missing policies for:

- Basketball (Men's & Women's)
- Football
- Gymnastics
- Lacrosse
- Soccer
- Softball
- Tennis (Men's & Women's)
- Volleyball
- Wrestling

### 4. Common Policies Identification

Based on the comprehensive sport policy files, these policies appear across multiple sports and should be consolidated into the Common Section:

#### Universal Policies (All Sports):

1. **Conference Credentials** - Referenced in all sport files
2. **Public Comments Policy** - Appears in all manuals
3. **Sportsmanship & Ethical Conduct** - Universal requirement
4. **Issues Not Addressed** - Standard fallback policy
5. **Conference Branding** - Applies to all sports
6. **Academic Awards Program** - Same structure across all sports
7. **Travel Issues/Contingencies** - Standard procedures

#### Competition-Related Common Policies:

1. **Ejected/Disqualified Player Procedures** - Same across all sports
2. **Game Management/Crowd Control** - Universal safety protocols
3. **Officials Medical Attention** - Standard medical procedures
4. **Player-Guest Admissions Policy** - Consistent ticket allocation
5. **Teamworks Integration** - Same system for all sports

#### Administrative Common Policies:

1. **Trophy Policy** - Referenced across multiple sports
2. **Conference Scheduling Obligations** - Universal scheduling rules
3. **Change of Schedule Procedures** - Same form/process for all
4. **Rescheduling Policies** - Universal weather/emergency procedures

### 5. Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions Needed:

1. **Verify Handbook Completeness**
   - Confirm if the current handbook is complete or just a Baseball excerpt
   - Locate comprehensive handbook if it exists separately

2. **Consolidate Common Policies**
   - Move the identified common policies to `big12-common-section-policies.md`
   - Remove duplicated policies from individual sport files
   - Maintain sport-specific references to common policies

3. **Fill Policy Gaps**
   - Add missing policies from handbook to Baseball comprehensive file
   - Verify if similar gaps exist in other sport files

#### Policy Consolidation Priority:

**High Priority (Move to Common Section):**

- Conference Credentials
- Public Comments Policy
- Sportsmanship & Ethical Conduct
- Academic Awards Program
- Ejected/Disqualified Player Procedures
- Teamworks Integration

**Medium Priority:**

- Game Management/Crowd Control
- Officials Medical Attention
- Trophy Policy
- Travel Issues/Contingencies

**Sport-Specific (Keep in Individual Files):**

- Competition formats and schedules
- Sport-specific equipment requirements
- Officials assignments and fees (sport-specific)
- Awards criteria (sport-specific variations)

### 6. Next Steps

1. **Validate the handbook** - Determine if it's complete or partial
2. **Create common policy consolidation plan**
3. **Update individual sport files** to reference common policies
4. **Ensure no policies are lost** in the consolidation process
5. **Verify consistency** across all policy documents

### 7. Structure Recommendation
